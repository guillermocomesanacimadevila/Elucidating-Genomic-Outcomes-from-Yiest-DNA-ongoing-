Aiming to elucidate certain genomic features from a FASTA file concerning raw Yeast DNA.
Genomic features of interest:
-> "AUG" start codon to stop codon ("UAA", "UAG", "UGA") gene counter.
-> Remaining non AUG-starting genes count.

-> Counter of all "CUG" specific Leucine encoding codons.
-> Counter of all non-CUG Leucine encoding codons.
-> Graphical representation of CUG vs non-CUG Leucine-specific codon frequency.
